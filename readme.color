This project is an AI-powered Color Analysis Web App that determines a user’s seasonal palette based on their facial features 
and image characteristics.The application provides an automated 12-season color analysis, commonly used in styling and 
personal fashion recommendations.The system analyzes undertones, value, contrast, and chroma extracted directly from the
uploaded image.The app uses Gemini Vision AI, which processes the photo and returns structured color analysis output.
The user interface is fully built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TailwindCSS for a clean, modern layout.
A multi-step workflow guides the user through account creation, login, image upload, and final analysis.
The application supports client-side authentication, allowing users to register and log in securely.
The AI model returns details such as season type, best color palette, contrast level, and undertone clarity.
Results are rendered visually with a curated palette grid, showing ideal colors for the user.
The app features a loading animation during analysis to improve user experience.
A structured JSON output from the AI is parsed and displayed dynamically on the result page.
Users can restart the analysis at any time through the Start Over feature.The design uses responsive components 
optimized for both mobile and desktop screens.All styling elements—including shadows, rounded cards, spacing,
and typography—are built using Tailwind’s utility classes.The app loads images in base64 format enabling fast AI 
communication and processing.No backend processing is required as the AI calls are executed entirely on the client-side 
JavaScript layer.The project uses fetch() API to send the user photo to the Gemini endpoint.The system ensures error handling 
for missing images, invalid uploads, or API failures.The app uses modern Web Development principles like DOM Manipulation,
modular functions, and async/await programming patterns.File uploads are previewed directly in the UI for user clarity before analysis.
Workflow & Client Logic

Async/Await + Fetch API – For smooth, asynchronous AI requests.

Base64 Encoding – Sends images securely and reliably to the AI model.

Dynamic Rendering – Generates palette blocks, results, and explanations on the fly.

Local Storage – Stores user session data (optional feature).
